# Blockchain Server Client Node
This is a "mockchain" created in an attempt to learn more about cryptocurrency and blockchain. The objective of the project was to create my very own cyptocurrency, with the ability to replicate blocks, "mine" the currency, and transfer it between users. The currency itself (named "Soo-Yen", after a friend) reached an all time peak value of $0.0000032 due to an initial transaction for the worth of one dollar. 

This project was made entirely in javascript, with some references in Solidity. Feel free to fork this repo to create your own mockchains (or contact me if you want some Soo-Yen for yourself).
